Code Location: https://github.com/juancarlosmaggi/CS-7641_SupervisedLearning


Original Data
Anime MAL: https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database

Heart Disease UCI: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

Requires Python 3
PIP: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

Original anime data goes into the data_prep folder as anime.csv
Original heart data goes into the data_prep folder as heart.csv

To recreate the whole process
1) python process_data.py
2) python split_data.py
3) python decisionTree.py
4) python boosting.py
5) python knn.py
6) python svm.py
7) python neural.py

Step 3 through 7 will generate the images in the images folder
I also created the *_GS.py files to help me get started with the parameters I needed to use for my graph generations.
